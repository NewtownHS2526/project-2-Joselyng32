        <h1>Pop music</h1>
        <p>Pop music originated from the fusion of rock and roll with other genres in the mid-1950s in the United States and United Kingdom, becoming more distinct from rock by the late 1960s. Its evolution was heavily influenced by the invention of sound recording and the radio, which enabled music to be spread more widely and become more commercial and accessible. Icons like Elvis Presley in the 1950s and The Beatles in the 1960s were pivotal in shaping the genre into its modern form. </p>
